We are proud to announce that our department has been awarded a prestigious Horizon Europe research grant worth €2.5 million for the project "Intelligent Autonomous Systems for Smart Manufacturing."

## Project Overview

The three-year project, led by Prof. Jan Kowalski, will focus on developing next-generation autonomous robotic systems for flexible manufacturing environments. The research will address key challenges in:

- Adaptive path planning in dynamic production environments
- Safe human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces
- AI-driven quality control systems
- Energy-efficient robotic operations

## International Collaboration

The project involves collaboration with 8 partners from 6 European countries:
- Technical University of Munich (Germany)
- ETH Zurich (Switzerland)
- KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden)
- University of Bologna (Italy)
- Siemens AG (Germany)
- ABB Robotics (Switzerland)

## Expected Impact

The project aims to:
1. Develop new algorithms for autonomous navigation in complex environments
2. Create safer collaborative robotic systems
3. Improve manufacturing efficiency by 30%
4. Reduce energy consumption in robotic operations by 25%

## Team

The research team will include:
- 4 Ph.D. students
- 2 postdoctoral researchers
- Collaboration with faculty members from multiple departments

This grant represents a significant achievement for our department and will strengthen our position as a leading research center in autonomous systems and robotics.
