A team of our undergraduate students has won first place at the Polish National Robotics Competition held in Warsaw on February 8-9, 2024.

## The Competition

The competition, organized by the Polish Robotics Society, brought together 25 teams from universities across Poland. Teams were challenged to design and build an autonomous mobile robot capable of:
- Navigating through a complex obstacle course
- Identifying and collecting specific objects
- Delivering items to designated locations
- Completing tasks within a 5-minute time limit

## Our Winning Team

The "CyberBots" team consisted of:
- Marek Lewandowski (team leader) - Computer Science, 3rd year
- Katarzyna Dąbrowska - Robotics, 3rd year
- Tomasz Kowalczyk - Control Engineering, 2nd year
- Magdalena Wójcik - Mechatronics, 2nd year

## Technical Solution

The team's robot featured:
- Custom-designed chassis with omnidirectional wheels
- ROS-based control system
- Computer vision using deep learning for object recognition
- Advanced path planning with dynamic obstacle avoidance

The robot's performance was particularly impressive in the obstacle avoidance challenges, completing the course 45 seconds faster than the second-place team.

## Faculty Support

The team was supervised by Dr. Anna Nowak and had access to our Mobile Robotics Laboratory for development and testing. "The students demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills and teamwork," said Dr. Nowak. "This victory is a testament to the quality of education and research opportunities available in our department."

## What's Next

The team will represent Poland at the European Robotics Championship in Vienna this June. We wish them continued success!

Congratulations to our students on this outstanding achievement! 🎉🤖
