We are excited to announce significant upgrades to our laboratory facilities, enhancing both research capabilities and student learning experiences.

## New Equipment

### Mobile Robotics Laboratory

Thanks to funding from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, we have acquired:

- **5 additional TurtleBot3 platforms**: Expanding our fleet for multi-robot research and larger student groups
- **OptiTrack motion capture system upgrade**: Increasing tracking accuracy and coverage area
- **2 DJI Matrice 300 RTK drones**: Enabling aerial robotics research and UAV-UGV coordination studies

The new drones come equipped with:
- RTK positioning for centimeter-level accuracy
- Advanced obstacle avoidance sensors
- 55-minute flight time
- Weather-resistant design (IP45 rating)

### Industrial Robotics Laboratory

Recent additions include:

- **Universal Robots UR5e collaborative robot**: The latest model with improved force sensing
- **Robotiq Hand-E adaptive gripper**: For precise manipulation tasks
- **Cognex vision system**: Supporting advanced computer vision research

### Control Systems Laboratory

New equipment for control research:

- **3 dSPACE MicroLabBox systems**: State-of-the-art rapid prototyping platforms
- **Quanser AERO quadrotor**: For nonlinear control education and research
- **Power electronics test bench**: Supporting research in electric drive control

## Research Opportunities

These upgrades open new research directions:

1. **Multi-Domain Robotics**: Coordinated control of ground and aerial vehicles
2. **Precision Agriculture**: Using drones for crop monitoring and analysis
3. **Advanced Manipulation**: Complex grasping and assembly tasks
4. **Real-Time Control**: Implementation of advanced controllers on fast systems

## Student Benefits

Students will benefit through:
- Hands-on experience with industry-standard equipment
- More opportunities for individual projects
- Better preparation for careers in robotics and automation
- Access to tools used in cutting-edge research

## Laboratory Access

The new equipment is available for:
- Course laboratories
- Bachelor and Master thesis projects
- Ph.D. research
- Research collaborations

Training sessions on the new equipment will be held throughout March. Students interested in using the new facilities should contact the respective laboratory directors.

We look forward to the innovative research and projects that these new capabilities will enable!
