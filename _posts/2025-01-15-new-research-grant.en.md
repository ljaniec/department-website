We are proud to announce that our department has been awarded a prestigious Horizon Europe research grant worth €2.5 million for the project "Intelligent Autonomous Systems for Smart Manufacturing."

## Project Overview

The three-year project, led by Prof. Jan Kowalski, will focus on developing next-generation autonomous robotic systems for flexible manufacturing environments. The research will address key challenges in:

- Adaptive path planning in dynamic production environments
- Safe human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces
- AI-driven quality control systems
- Energy-efficient robotic operations
