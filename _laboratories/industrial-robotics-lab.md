The Industrial Robotics and Automation Laboratory focuses on developing and testing advanced robotic systems for industrial applications. The lab bridges the gap between academic research and industrial practice.

## Overview

Our laboratory features a complete industrial automation cell that mimics real production environments. This allows students and researchers to work with industry-standard equipment and develop practical solutions.

## Research Focus

### Collaborative Robotics

We investigate safe human-robot collaboration through:
- Force-limited control strategies
- Real-time collision detection
- Intuitive programming interfaces
- Adaptive behavior based on human presence

The control system ensures safety by limiting forces according to ISO/TS 15066:

$$F_{contact} \leq F_{max}(\text{body region})$$

### Vision-Guided Manipulation

Our vision systems enable:
- Object recognition and localization
- Bin picking applications
- Quality inspection
- Pose estimation for grasping

### Assembly Automation

Research in automated assembly includes:
- Part insertion with compliance control
- Multi-part assembly sequences
- Error detection and recovery

## Teaching Activities

The laboratory supports courses in:
- Industrial Robotics (graduate)
- Automation Systems (undergraduate)
- Robotic Vision (graduate)

Students gain hands-on experience with:
- Robot programming (offline and online)
- PLC programming
- Vision system configuration
- Safety system design

## Industry Partnerships

We collaborate with leading companies to:
- Develop custom automation solutions
- Test new technologies
- Train engineers
- Conduct joint research projects

## Safety

The laboratory is equipped with:
- Safety light curtains
- Emergency stop systems
- Certified collaborative robot operations
- Regular safety training for all users

All operations comply with international safety standards for industrial robotics.
